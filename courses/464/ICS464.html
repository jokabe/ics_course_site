  <p><strong>Description</strong>: Application of concepts and methodologies of human factors, psychology and software engineering to address ergonomic, cognitive, and social factors in the design and evaluation of human-computer systems.</p>

  <p><strong>Objectives</strong>: - Understand the basic principles of human-computer interaction.
    - Be knowledgeable about the basic human information processing systems of perception, cognition, and action.
    - Be knowledgeable about how attention, affect, and environment influence human behavior.
    - Understand how to discover and describe the characteristics of diverse users of information systems.
    - Understand and have experience applying several interaction design principles.
    - Understand and have experience using several user evaluation techniques.
    - Understand how interaction design fits into the iterative development process.
    - Be familiar with interaction designers’ tools and work practices, including needs and requirements gathering, iterative prototyping, user testing, field studies, and both oral and written design presentation.</p>

  <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: two ICS 300-level courses or consent.</p>

  <p><strong>Textbook(s)</strong>: Sharp, H., Rogers, Y, &amp; Preece, J. (2011). Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction. Second Edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons.</p>

  <p>Norman, D. (2013). The design of everyday things. Revised and expanded edition. Basic Books.</p>

  <p>Norman, D. (2004). Emotional design. Basic Books.</p>

  <p><strong>Grading</strong>: Participation: 15%
    2 exams: 15% each
    Project: 55%</p>

  <p>Grade Calculation:
    &gt;89=A, 80-89=B, 70-79=C, 60-69=D, &lt;60=F
    Plus and minus are part of the final grade.
    All work must be completed to receive a grade in the course.</p>

  <p><strong>Policies</strong>: Activities
    Each week we will have a lecture on Monday and an interactive seminar session on Wednesday. In the seminar session we will discuss:
    •	Chapter readings for the week
    •	Any articles assigned for the week
    •	Project ideas and progress
    The Wednesday interactive seminar is your opportunity to participate in discussion and earn points for the participation requirement.</p>

  <p>Project
    The course project will involve designing an interactive application based on user requirements. In the first couple of weeks we will form groups (3-4 people each) and pick interesting and challenging topics. In the next couple of weeks the groups will plan goals and a schedule for: A user study? Fieldwork observations? A survey? A prototype with iterations? A requirements document? Etc. This will all make sense as the course evolves.
    The final output of the group projects will be:
    •	Periodic progress reports on seminar days throughout the semester.
    •	A presentation in the second-to-last week
    •	A poster at a design showcase
    •	A final report summarizing what the group did (due during finals week).</p>

  <p><strong>Schedule</strong>: Week 1: What is Interaction Design?
    Week 2: Understanding and Conceptualizing Interaction
    Week 3: Understanding Users
    Week 4: Collaboration and Communication
    Week 5: Affect

<p>The following graphic illustrates the general prerequisite structure for courses related to ICS degree programs.</p>

<p>Please consult the <a href="http://www.catalog.hawaii.edu/courses/departments/ics.htm">ICS Course Catalog</a> and the ICS academic plan document for details on the precise prerequisites for each course.  For example, in some cases the prerequisites are “any two 300-level courses”, or “either 314 or 361”. Such nuances are not illustrated below.</p>
